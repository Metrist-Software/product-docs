In this document, we explain how we handle that data. Currently, we consider the following data to be sensitive:</p><ul><li>Any monitor configuration settings, like API keys, you store with us either through our API or through our Web UI. We encrypt this data with a monitor-specific random key.</li><li>User email addresses. We encrypt this data with a user-specific random key.</li><li>Your account name. We encrypt this data with an account-specific random key.</li></ul><p>Please contact us if your security compliance requires you to have more data classified this way. Note that we may extend this list at any time without prior notice.</p><h2 id="encryption-in-transit" tabindex="-1">Encryption in transit <a class="header-anchor" href="#encryption-in-transit" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>All data communicated to the Metrist application servers is encrypted in transit with TLS 1.2 or better.

The random key is only accessible by the Metrist backend and by our technical staff.</p><p>We use the Erlang <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/crypto.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">standard cryptography library</a> for encryption and subsequent decription of data.</p><h2 id="destruction-of-keys" tabindex="-1">Destruction of keys <a class="header-anchor" href="#destruction-of-keys" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>At your request, we will delete any key associated with your account with Metrist.
