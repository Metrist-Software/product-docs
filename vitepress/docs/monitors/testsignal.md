## Monitor Specs

Description

:   This monitor just sends a test signal through the system so we can verify that things are correctly working. Two checks generate random numbers from a Poisson and Normal distribution; the third always returns zero so we can measure monitor invocation overhead.

Name

: `testsignal`

Packages

: [testsignal](testsignal_testsignal.md)
