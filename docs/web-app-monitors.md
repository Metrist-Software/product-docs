## Configuring service monitors

After you've created your account, you may want to add more service monitors to your account â€” Metrist is adding new ones every month! You may also want to remove a service monitor, as it may no longer be relevant to you and your organization.

1. Click on the _Service Monitors_ tab.
2. Click the _Manage_ button.
3. Select or deselect the service monitors you'd like access to by clicking on the monitor panel or checkbox.
4. Click the _Save changes_ button.
