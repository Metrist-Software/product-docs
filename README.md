## Viewing docs locally

The docs can be run locally with the following steps:
1. `pip install mkdocs`
2. Confirm installation with `mkdocs --version`. If an error comes up, you may need to preface this and the next command with `python -m`
3. `mkdocs serve`

The docs should be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
