## Monitor Config Registration

With monitor configuration now available in your local instance of Orchestrator, the last step is to inform Metrist of your monitor. Metrist will then run schedule the appropriate tests and record the relevant telemetry data (e.g., “orchestrate”).

In the following code, adjust the values of `interval_secs` and `run_groups` to suit your needs. `run_groups` **must** include at least 1 value in the list defined in `METRIST_RUN_GROUPS` environment variable. Leave all other values as they are defined below.
