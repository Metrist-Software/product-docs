## Produced by Metrist

We publish a [Library of Monitors](/monitors/shared/) that we use ourselves and make available to all Metrist customers. These are a good starting point after you have [installed Orchestrator](/guides/orchestrator-installation).

## Produce Your Own <Badge type="warning" text="experimental" />

We encourage customers to produce their own monitors. Expect more documentation in this area soon.
